- Saving manga information to text file.(Status: Might be doable )
	- Could potentially grab the manga information for mangas downloaded this session and generate an html page that can be saved manually.
	- Actually might be able to make the html page save automatically with each download. Revived!

- Overhaul the options menu:
	- Create a proper drop & drag system or swap it out for a text formatting system, for both Image Name and Folder Name.
	- Look into adding more options to the File Conflict dropdown.
	- Tabs for options, changelog and potentially more.
	- Option to check for direct download links first. (Depends on what hosts are being used as to how worthwhile I see it as being)

- Download subscriptions
	- possibly add a system that will grab the latest mangas and notify you when a new one is added (might be that subscriptions is enough)
	- option to only show mangas in english/japanese, possibly even other options(which would make it more into a filter system)(Works but currently only for tags)
	- remove old localStorage notification data(Working but disabled for now)
	or
	- Possibly add some way of telling when you have already downloaded/read a manga
	- Look into gathering info and such in the background to speed up pageloads(Had issues in the past). Maybe even pass it into the localstorage variable through the background script.
	- Since the addition of the Fakku API possibly change to only use one script for downloading instead of two since all the extra information seems to be on the /read page as well.
	- Update the tag tooltips once fakku has added descriptions to the newer ones.

- Download series/artist
	- Download everything when searching/browsing an artist

- Clicked/Floating Text
	- Possibly disable all background elements while a floating text is active. To prevent accidentally clicking twice on the remove button.

- Filtering
	- Possibly only match whole words.

- Other
	- Remove older mangas causing errors, because of removal, from the arraylist.
	- Look into why generating links is slow, if it's checking the server for no reason on errors or some other issue is causing it. (not sure if fixed from fixing related issue)
