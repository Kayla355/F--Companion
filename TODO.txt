- Saving manga information to text file.(Pretty sure this can't be done :( )
	- Could potentially grab the manga information for mangas downloaded this session and generate an html page that can be saved manually.
	- Actually might be able to make the html page save automatically with each download. Revived!

- Overhaul the options menu:
	- Create a proper drop & drag system or swap it out for a text formatting system, for both Image Name and Folder Name.
	- Look into adding more options to the File Conflict dropdown.
	- Tabs for options, changelog and potentially more.
	- Option to check for direct download links first. (Depends on what hosts are being used as to how worthwhile I see it as being)

- Download subscriptions
	- possibly add a system that will grab the latest mangas and notify you when a new one is added (might be that subscriptions is enough)
	- fix links located in a description closing the popup even when they are ctrl/middle-clicked(This already works in Opera by default)
	- option to only show mangas in english/japanese, possibly even other options(which would make it more into a filter system)(Works but currently only for tags)
	- remove old localStorage notification data(Working but disabled for now)
	or
	- parse x amount at a time and scrolling causes older ones to appear(would need to change the way arraynames are stored.)
	- Possibly add some way of telling when you have already downloaded/read a manga
	- Add an internal timer to entries so they still update after they are no longer on the notifications page.
	- Look into gathering info and such in the background to speed up pageloads(Had issues in the past). Maybe even pass it into the localstorage variable through the background script.
	- Since the addition of the Fakku API possibly change to only use one script for downloading instead of two since all the extra information seems to be on the /read page as well.
	- Update the tag tooltips once fakku has added descriptions to the newer ones.

- Download series/artist
	- Download everything when searching/browsing an artist

- Clicked/Floating Text
	- Possibly disable all background elements while a floating text is active. To prevent accidentally clicking twice on the remove button.

- Filtering
	- Possibly only match whole words.
