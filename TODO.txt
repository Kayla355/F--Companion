- Saving manga information to text file.(Pretty sure this can't be done :( )

- Overhaul the options menu:
	- Create a proper drop & drag system or swap it out for a text formatting system, for both Image Name and Folder Name.
	- Look into adding more options to the File Conflict dropdown.
	- Tabs for options, changelog and potentially more.
	- Option to check for direct download links first. (Depends on what hosts are being used as to how worthwhile I see it as being)

- Download subscriptions
	- Check if cookie has expired, if so notification to log in again.
	- Automatic checker on timer
	- Automatic mode & notify mode
	- remove notification for downloaded
	- Notification icon + dropdown
	- remove old localStorage notification data
	or
	- parse x amount at a time and scrolling causes older ones to appear(would need to fix the way arraynames are stored.)

- Download series/artist
	- Download everything when searching/browsing an artist
