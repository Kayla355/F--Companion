- Saving manga information to text file.(Pretty sure this can't be done :( )

- Overhaul the options menu:
	- Create a proper drop & drag system or swap it out for a text formatting system, for both Image Name and Folder Name.
	- Look into adding more options to the File Conflict dropdown.
	- Tabs for options, changelog and potentially more.
	- Option to check for direct download links first. (Depends on what hosts are being used as to how worthwhile I see it as being)

- Download subscriptions
	- possibly add a system that will grab the latest mangas and prompt you when a new one is added (might be that subscriptions is enough)
	- add a refresh button prompting the background script to fetch notifications
	- add a cache refresh button to force an update for stored notifications
	- fix links located in a description closing the popup even when they are ctrl/middle-clicked
	- option to only show mangas in english/japanese, possibly even other options(which would make it more into a filter system)
	- remove old localStorage notification data
	or
	- parse x amount at a time and scrolling causes older ones to appear(would need to change the way arraynames are stored.)
	- Possibly add some way of telling when you have already downloaded/read a manga

- Download series/artist
	- Download everything when searching/browsing an artist

- Look into why loadingtrail freezes. Worked fine before...
