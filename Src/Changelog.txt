// Version 0.1
- First release

// Version 0.2
- General stability fixes when grabbing mangas.
- Added option for turning on or off run in background.

// Version 0.2.1
- Removed run in background option(for now) as it was causing issues when loading multiple tabs with mangas at once.
- Fixed issues when trying to download multiple mangas at once. It now waits until it has triggered all previous downloads.
- Added error message and solution(hopefully) that should fix any issues that might happen if the downloader gets interrupted.

// Version 0.2.2
- Fixed issues when the folder that was created ended with a "."(Actually a windows issue...), resulting in a failed download.

// Version 0.2.3
- Fixed an issue with options not saving.

// Version 0.3
- Added option for Incognito Downloads. (Useful if you don't actually want your Downloads History to be pretty much unusable because of spam from the images being downloaded)
- Added option for File Conflits. (Currently only Overwrite and Rename exist as I try to figure out how to gain more control over the 'conflictAction' event.)
- Fixed issues when trying to create a folder containing one of the following characters, \/:*?"<>|
- Added error messages when the server responded with an error when trying to grab links and info.
- Removed some defunct code that was no longer necessary.
- Fixed issues with grabbing the correct manga when browsing a random manga using /random
- Added support for notifications (requires Cookies)
- Added loading animation to indicate that the extension is working.(When grabbing notes for the first time it would feel like it was broken because it takes a decent amount of time)
- Should be working again from the new layout change to Fakku.

// Version 0.3.1
- Left something commented that shouldn't have been...

// Version 0.3.2
- Improved the way the extension loads in new notes(it should now load all old ones before beginning any new notes that will take longer to load).

// Version 0.3.3
- Renamed extension to F! Companion
- Minor fixes to when a manga did not exist.

// Version 0.3.4 (Un-released)
- The icon will now say "DL or "Link", depending on what option you have set, when it is the action that will be taken when pressed.
- Fixed an issue with removed(actually hidden...) items causing issues when loading in newer items at the top.
- Added "endless" scrolling to the notifications, which means that it will now load older entries as you reach the bottom of the page.
- Started storing the generated html page in localstorage which means it will now load close to instantanious as it will no longer have to generate new entries from stored data at every load.
- The menu will now always be shown at the top even when scrolling.
