// Version 0.1
- First release

// Version 0.2
- General stability fixes when grabbing mangas.
- Added option for turning on or off run in background.

// Version 0.2.1
- Removed run in background option(for now) as it was causing issues when loading multiple tabs with mangas at once.
- Fixed issues when trying to download multiple mangas at once. It now waits until it has triggered all previous downloads.
- Added error message and solution(hopefully) that should fix any issues that might happen if the downloader gets interrupted.

// Version 0.2.2
- Fixed issues when the folder that was created ended with a "."(Actually a windows issue...), resulting in a failed download.

// Version 0.2.3
- Fixed an issue with options not saving.

// Version 0.3
- Added option for Incognito Downloads. (Useful if you don't actually want your Downloads History to be pretty much unusable because of spam from the images being downloaded)
- Added option for File Conflits. (Currently only Overwrite and Rename exist as I try to figure out how to gain more control over the 'conflictAction' event.)
- Fixed issues when trying to create a folder containing one of the following characters, \/:*?"<>|
- Added error messages when the server responded with an error when trying to grab links and info.
- Removed some defunct code that was no longer necessary.
- Fixed issues with grabbing the correct manga when browsing a random manga using /random
